RUN ON MOZILLA FIREFOX PLEASE

The current code is on responsive, put the html file into firefox, then press ctrl + shift + M to set it to mobile mode. 

The main function Ghost run is working, click on new race -> ghost run -> Bedok reservoir.gpx

Currently this function is hardcoded.

It will display the gpx file on the map.

Clicking on start run will start a timer, and replacing each point every 5 seconds. 

Currently we do not have a function to stop and end the run with a summary yet.
